dressr
============  
*dressr* is an Android application that was created in 48 hours for the 2016 CSUS Coding Hackathon, which had the theme of 'First World Problems'. As a result, dressr was created to address the struggle of choosing an outfit to wear. dressr keeps track of the clothes owned by the user in a virtual closet and will display randomly generated outfits. 

In this app, users are also able to:
- Browse through suggested outfits by simply swiping right to view other outfits
- Add clothing items to their closet by taking pictures of their clothes 
- Remove clothes from their closet 
- View the clothes in their closet by category
